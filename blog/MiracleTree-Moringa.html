        <p>If there were a hall of fame for superfoods, <strong>Moringa Oleifera</strong> would be at the very top.

        <h3 class="h5">3. Natural, Caffeine-Free Vitality</h3>
        <p>Unlike coffee or energy drinks that lead to a crash, Moringa provides a steady increase in energy levels. It contains B-vitamins that help the body convert food into fuel, making it a favorite for "Natural Energy" beverage formulations.</p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">4. A Complete Plant-Based Protein</h3>
        <p>Moringa is one of the rare plants that contains all 9 essential amino acids. This makes it a vital ingredient for the vegan and vegetarian markets, providing high-quality protein for smoothies, protein bars, and meal replacements.</p>
