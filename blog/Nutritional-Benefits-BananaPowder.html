      <section class="mb-4">
        <p>While fresh bananas are a household staple, <strong>Organic Green Banana Powder</strong> is emerging as a functional "super-ingredient" in the global health market. Unlike the sweet powder made from ripe fruit, green banana powder is milled from unripened bananas, preserving a unique nutritional profile that is low in sugar and high in fiber.</p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">1. The Gut-Health Hero: Resistant Starch</h3>
        <p>The standout feature of green banana powder is its high concentration of <strong>Resistant Starch (RS2)</strong>. Unlike typical carbs, RS2 acts as a prebiotic, bypassing the small intestine to feed beneficial gut bacteria. This supports a healthy microbiome, improves digestion, and reduces bloating.</p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">2. Natural Weight & Blood Sugar Management</h3>
        <p>Because it is slowly digested, banana powder provides a sustained release of energy. It has a lower Glycemic Index (GI) than wheat flour or ripe bananas, helping to regulate insulin response and promoting a feeling of fullness that aids in weight management.</p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">3. Essential Minerals: Potassium and Magnesium</h3>
        <p>IndiRoot's banana powder retains the essential electrolytes found in fresh fruit. Potassium is vital for heart health and muscle function, making this powder an excellent additive for post-workout recovery blends.</p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">4. Versatile Applications in Food Industry</h3>
        <p>For manufacturers and home bakers, banana powder is a game-changer. It is naturally gluten-free and has a neutral, slightly nutty flavor. It can be used as a thickener for sauces, an enrichment for infant foods, or a 1:1 flour replacement in many gluten-free recipes.</p>
